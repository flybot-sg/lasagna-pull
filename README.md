## Rational

Data for an application can be big, most of them are maps or collection of maps, we always need a way to allow user to select derived data from a recursive data structure. 

Clojure has built-in function like `select-keys` can return same shape data from a big map, but it is too limited.

Inspired by [Datomic Pull API](https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/pull.html) and [EQL](https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/what-is-eql.html), this simple library provide you a simple and precise pattern allow you to pull data out in one call.

## Query pattern

Generally, query patterns just have same structure of your data, where there is a map, you use map in place of it; where there is a sequence (vector, list, etc.) of maps, you use a vector in place.

You mark the data you are interested by a special `'?`, so:

```clojure
(pull/run '{:a ?,:b ?} {:a 1, :b 2, c: 3}) => [{:a 1, :b 2} {}]
```
This works just like `select-keys`, only query patterns look like an example; but why is the returned value a pair of maps here?

Because query patterns also support logical variable, so `run` returns the matched data and a logical variable map, let's try:

```clojure
(pull/run '{:a ?a, :b ?b} {:a 1, :b 2, :c 3}) => [{:a 1, :b 2} {'?a 1 '?b 2}]
```

You can expect that scalar value works like a filter, causing matching fail:

```clojure
(pull/run '{:a ?, :b 2}) {:a 1, :b 1}) => [{} {}] ;; value of :b does not match pattern
```

and if same logical variable can not contain a single value, then all of them fail:

```clojure
(pull/run '{:a ?x, :b ?x} {:a 2, :b 1}) => [{} {}]
```

Of course pattern support nested maps:

```clojure
(pull/run '{:a {:b ?b}} {:a {:b 3}}) => [{:a {:b 3}} {'?b 3}]
```

### special cases

To match a sequence of maps, using `[]` to surround it:

```clojure
(pull/run '[{:a ?}] [{:a 3, :b 4} {:a 1} {}]) => [[{:a 3} {:a 1} {}], {}]
```

Put logical variable after this single inner map, binding it to the whole sequence:

```clojure
(pull/run '[{:a ?} ?x] [{:a 3, :b 4} {:a 1} {}]) => [[{:a 3} {:a 1} {}], {'?x [{:a 3} {:a 1} {}]}]
```
